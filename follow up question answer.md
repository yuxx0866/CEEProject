# Answer to follow up questions

Below are 9 questions I would discuss with non-technical team to evaluate database options.

- What database are you currently using?

    - Changing to a new database is time-consuming. If the current database can satisfy new data needs and will function effectively for the next 1 to 2 years, then a change may not be necessary.

- What type of data will you be storing (e.g., text, numbers, images, videos, etc.)?

    - This information will help determine whether you need a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a specialized database like a time-series database.

- How much data do you expect to store now and in the future?

    - This question addresses scalability and will influence whether you need a solution that handles large volumes of data efficiently.

- How often will the data be accessed and updated?

    - Understanding the frequency of read and write operations can guide the choice between databases optimized for read-heavy or write-heavy operations.

- From where will the data be accessed (e.g., office network, remotely, mobile devices)?

    - This information will affect the decision on choosing cloud-based versus on-premises databases and considerations around data security and connectivity.

- What are your requirements for data security and compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?

    - Compliance requirements can significantly narrow down the database options based on their security features and certifications.

- Do you need to integrate with other systems or applications?

    - This will determine if you need a database that easily integrates with other software, possibly influencing the choice of database technologies that offer robust APIs and connectors. For instance, depending on your visualization tools, it is possible that the visualization tools only accept a few databases.

- What is your budget for database management and maintenance?

    - Cost considerations can affect the choice between enterprise, open-source solutions, and the need for in-house expertise versus managed services.

- What kind of analytics or reporting capabilities do you need from the database?

    - If advanced analytics or real-time reporting is required, you might lean towards databases with built-in analytics features or compatibility with analytics tools.
